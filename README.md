In this task, I developed a Java-based file handling utility that demonstrates how to work with filesâ€”specifically reading from a PDF file, writing its content into a text file, and later modifying that file by appending new data.

To achieve this, I used the Apache PDFBox library, which allows Java programs to read the contents of PDF documents. First, the program reads all the text from the uploaded PDF file. Then, it saves this extracted content into a new text file named output.txt.

After that, the program performs a modification operation by appending a new line of text to the same file, showing how text files can be updated without erasing previous data.

This task helped me understand file I/O operations, how to integrate external libraries in Java, and how to process real-world documents like PDFs. It also gave me practical experience in managing input/output streams, handling exceptions, and writing clean, well-documented code.
